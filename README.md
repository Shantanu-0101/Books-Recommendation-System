# Books-Recommendation-System
A collaborative filtering-based recommendation system that suggests 4â€“5 similar books to the user based on their selection.
The web app is built with Flask and uses cosine similarity on preprocessed book data to recommend titles.


<h2>How it works:</h2>
-Dataset is preprocessed (removing duplicates, cleaning, structuring).
-A cosine similarity matrix is created based on user-book interactions.
-When a user selects a book, the system finds the most similar books using collaborative filtering.
-Flask serves the recommendations on a user-friendly web page.
